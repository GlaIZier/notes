Java
Representation of information in computer? // 2
What is the size of Integer in 32 bit and 64bit Java? // 4 bytes
Max value of Integer? // 2^31 - 1? Why -1? How to get it in Java? // Integer.MAX_VALUE
What will happen if we increment max int by one? // -2147483648

What structure String is based on?
What is complexity of String.substring() in Java? Java 6, 7? Why did they change the behavior?

How to create an array of generics? // new Object[] and casting but then while returning this array as T[] there will be class cast exception because actually it is Object[] or  public GA(Class<T> type, int size) {
        a = (T[]) Array.newInstance(type, size);
    } 
}


Covariance and contrvariance?
Arrays are covariant in Java: [Fruit] <- [Apple] <- [Jonathan]:
Fruit[] fruits = new Apple[10];
fruits[0] = new Apple(); // Ok
fruits[1] = new Jonathan(); // Ok
But the actual type is Apple[], so
fruits[2] = new Fruit() // Exception
fruits[3] = new Orange // Exception

List<? extends Number> l = new ArrayList<Integer>();
l = new ArrayList<Double>();
l = new ArrayList<Number>();
//        l = new ArrayList<Object>();
//        l.add(new Object());
//        l.add(new Integer(5));
l.add(null);

List<? super Number> l2 = new ArrayList<Number>();
l2 = new ArrayList<Object>();
//        l2 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
l2.add(new Integer(5));
l2.add(new Number() {...});
//        l2.add(new Object());
l2.add(null);


Algorithms:
What is hash?
What is good hash?
HashMap and TreeMap: internal structure?
Why is TreeMap sorted?
Why is HashMap unsorted?
Which one is faster?
What is a good data structure for cache in Java with evicting and searching? // LinkedHashMap
How to implement a good data structure for it?

What is the complexity of substing?
Can you create a data structure for string that will return substring in constant time? 


Linux: 
You have a cluster. And it becomes to respond not every time or it takes so much time to respond. What would u do to understand what is the reasone of that? // ping, top, logs, ps to find logs, systemctl, iptables.
U have some library that is a wrapper around some api? And it returns some weird error, or not what u expected. What would u do? With sources? Without sources? // tcpdump, Wireshark

Git:
Typical flow? // git log, git branch, git branch --remote, git branch, git checkout, git merge
How to make one commit from two? // rebase --interactive HEAD~2 pick   b76d157 b squash a931ac7 c

Debug:
How do u debug?

Deploy:
How do u deploy in your company?

DB:
What are indexes?
Do we always need indexes?
When full scan can be faster than index search?
Will index work if index.substring(3, 7)?
Cover index?
Cluster index and non one? // index connected to the data itself
The most typic datastructure to store indexes? // b-tree
B-tree? Hash index? Diff? When do we need to choose one or other?
