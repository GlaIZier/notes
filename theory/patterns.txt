//Proxy
Is widely used in Spring to implement AOP principle and to inject session type beans in singleton one. Spring use proxies to handle such situations. Also is used in OSGI to handle dynamic module load.

SimpleProxy:
inteface I {
	void m();
}

class C implements I {
	void m();
}

class Proxy implements I {
	public Proxy(I proxied) {
	 ...
	}

	void m() {
		... // some proxied actions
		proxied.m(); // call for proxied class
	}
}

DynamicProxy:
class DynamicProxyHandler implements InvocationHandler {
	public DynamicProxyHandler(Object proxied) {
		this.proxied = proxied;
	}
	public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) {
		... // some proxy logic
		return method.invoke(proxied, args);
	}
}

RealObject real = new RealObject();
Interface proxy = (Interface) Proxy.newProxyInstance(Interface.class.getClassLoader(), new Class[]{ Interface.class }, new DynamicProxyHandler(real));
proxy.m();

//DI
Ex. public ConstructedClass() { new AnotherConstructedClassImpl; ...} -> public ConstructedClass(IAnotherConstructedClass acc) {...}. So first example is depended on AnotherConstructedClassImpl, but in the second one we inject dependency interface (IAnotherConstructedClass) in code. That's why it is called dependency injection.
DI is used in Spring. Di is one impl of IoC principle

//Ioc Principle
The sample is similar to the one above in DI. You have inverted control by handing the responsibility of creating the AnotherConstructedClassImpl from the ConstructedClass to the caller.
In term of frameworks this principle means from Martin Fowler:
When I first ran into inversion of control, it was in the main control of a user interface. Early user interfaces were controlled by the application program. You would have a sequence of commands like "Enter name", "enter address"; your program would drive the prompts and pick up a response to each one. With graphical (or even screen based) UIs the UI framework would contain this main loop and your program instead provided event handlers for the various fields on the screen. The main control of the program was inverted, moved away from you to the framework.
To clarify a little: Inversion of Control means anything which inverts the control structure of a program from the classic procedural design.
In days of yore, a key example of this was letting a framework handle communication between a UI and your code, rather than leaving your code to generate the UI directly or do smth ordinary directly.
In more recent times (when such frameworks pretty much dominated, so the question was no longer relevant), an example was inverting control over the instantiation of objects.
Fowler, and others, decided that the term Inversion of Control covered too many techniques and we needed a new term for the specific example of instantiation of objects (Dependency Injection) but, by the time that agreement had been made, the phrase "IoC Container" had taken off.
This muddies the water a lot, because an IoC container is a specific kind of Dependency Injection, but Dependency Injection is a specific kind of Inversion of Control. This is why you're getting such confused answers, no matter where you look.


//Singleton
One instance in application.

//Facade
Ex. SLF4j -> Logback, log4j

//Callback, Observer
libraryMethod(MyImplOfLIbraryInterface myImpl). MyImplOfLibraryOfInterface { @override libraryMethod() {my code here}}.
Ex. JdbcTemplate

//Context
HashMap<Class<T>, singleton instance of T class>
Context in term of framework. Context smth that holds objects. Ex ApplicationContext in spring holds beans

// Skeleton
Ex. JdbcTemplate. Hide the same steps of process

// Adapter
We adapt existing class to different interface. Usually derivation is used. 
class LongReturner() {
	long returnLong(){...};
}

class LongReturnerAdapter extends LongReturner implements Readable {
	int read(CharBuffer cb) {
		String string = String.valueOf(returnLong());
		cb.append(string);
		return string.length();
	}
}

Ex. Some Spring adapters

// Adapter method
class Cont<T> implements Iterable<T> {
	public Iterator<T> iterator() {
		...
	}
}

class AdaptReverseCont<T> extends Cont<T> {
	public Iterator<T> revIterator() {
		<reversed implementation>
	}
}

psvm() {
	for (T t : cont) {
	 <implementation>
	}
	for (T t : cont.revIterator()) {
	 <reversed implementation>
	}
}

// Strategy
When method (Scanner constructor) accepts any interface (Readable):
Ex. Scanner: Scanner(Readable r) {}

// Factory
Creates instance using some criteria like switch case or interface. 

interface Game{ void move()}
inteface GameFactory {Game getGame()}

class Checkers impl Game{}
class Chess impl Game{}

class CheckersFactory impl GameFactory { Game getGame() {return new Checkers()}}
class ChessFactory impl GameFactory { Game getGame() {return new Chess()}}

playGame(GameFactory gf) {
	gf.getGame().play();
}

main() {
	playGame(new CheckersFactory());
	playGame(new ChessFactory());
}
Also we can include factory classes to Game implementations as static methods returned anonymous factory implementation.

Ex. Some SAP libraries for Java, BeanFactory in Spring

//  Universal interfaces 
Sometimes there is a problem when u have some general interface for example Dao for payment system and lots of implementations like sber, cyberplat, qiwi ...
But these implementation somewhere are very close to each other (addPayment()) but somewhere are not (getVersion()). So, what should we do? Do we need to place all possible methods to the parent Dao and make implementations to throw UnsupportedOperationException? There are three possible strategies:
1. make the universal interface and make implementations to throw UnsupportedOperationException.
2. like the first one but make adapters for each specific implementation.
3. make the hierarchy of specific dao interfaces and place there some specific for each implementations methods. And use the runtime type info for casting each dao to more specific dao interface.
4. make the specific methods more general to make them useful for the whole range of implementations(like, getVersion() -> getPaymentInforamtion())

// Generator 
Pattern to create instance of some class. Usually don't have any param in method. So, it returns some random element.
interface Generator<T> { T next(); } 

public class BGenerator<T> implements Generator<T> {
	private Class<T> type;
	public BGenerator(Class<T> type) {
	this.type = type;
	}
	public T next() {
		type.newInstance();
	}
	public static <T> Generator<T> create(Class<T> type) {
	return new BGenerator<T>(type);
	}
}

// Strategy
Leave unchangable logic in the method and provide changable logic incapsulated in the class:

Ex: Arrays.sort(T[], <? super T> comparator)

// Decorator
Is used to add functionality to the existing functionality:

DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(
	new ByteArrayInputStream(
		BufferedInputFile.read("file.java").getBytes()
	)
);
while (true)
	sout(in.readByte());

DataInputStream holds a link to ByteArrayInputStream which holds a link to BufferedInputFile. But they are all InputStream
So DataInputStream adds some custom functionality (decorates) and call for next inputstream read method and so forth.
