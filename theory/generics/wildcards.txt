U can't add anything except null in List<? extends Number> l = new ArrayList<Integer>()
because if u could then List<? extends Serializable> l = new ArrayList<String>(); l.add("fasd"); l.add(5); // so u add integer in list of strings
But u can get Number n = l.get(0); and of course u can cast result to specific type

U can't add anything in List<?>. U can read it as List of null; U can need it when ur algorithm doesn't need to know what places thare and can deal with these objects as with Objects. U can write List<Object> but it's more restrictive than List<?> because here u can assign List<MyClass>.
U can get Object o = l.get(0); and of course u can cast result to specific type

U can add to;
List<? super Serializable> s = new ArrayList<Serializable>();
s.add("sa"); // add string here because it's serializable
s.add(5); // add
// s.add(new Object()); // can't do it
Object o1 = s.get(0);
String s1 = (String) s.get(0);
Integer i1 = (Integer) s.get(1);
