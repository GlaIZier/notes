The most of spring functions work with proxy pattern. This means that annotations like @Transactional, @Aspect or @Async is nothing more then a pointer for beanpostprocessors to create proxies around it. 
So if you call, for instance, @Async method locally inside a class this method won't run concurrently.

Order of proxies is determined by bean postprocessors. And the order of calls for BeanPostProcessors is detemined by Spring (enclosed inside Spring and bean postprocessors' sources eg AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor: 	private int order = Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE - 2;)
